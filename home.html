            <h2>History of the breed</h2>
            <p>The Pug breed is one of the oldest breeds of dogs, with their origins dating back to 400 BC in China, where they were bred as companion animals for the upper class.</p>
            <p>Pugs kept court with Chinese Emperors and Tibetan Monks, and even had their own guards and servants to protect and care for them.</p>
            <p>The Chinese bred the dogs to maintain their wrinkles due to them resembling the Chinese character for "prince".</p>
            <p>Popularity of the breed spread out of China to Japan, Russia, and eventually, Europe. The aunt of Catherine the Great would take her pugs to church with her, and the Prince of Orange's pug alterted him to a midnight attack, securing their favor with European nobility.</p>

            <h2>Temperament and Conformation</h2>
            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>The pug personality, as all dogs, is unique, but there are certain aspects that are looked at when assessing for conformation.</p>
            <p>Pugs are very food oriented, so special attention must be made to this dog's weight, but their penchant for treats and other nibblets can make training a bit easier!</p>
            <p>Pugs are happiest when their owners are happy and have no problem showing their affection through kisses and cuddles.</p>
            <p>Their mixed energy level is perfect for kids, as they will enjoy running around and playing as well as lounging around on the sofa when they are away at school or work.</p>
            <p>"Molto en parvo" best describes the breed (much in little) as they have very large personalities smushed into little bodies! This makes them great with other dogs both big and small.</p>
            <p>This breed is very friendly with strangers, but they will also alert you to anything that is "off."</p>
            <h3>Color</h3>
            <p>The American Kennel Club recognizes two color patterns for Pugs: Fawn and Black.</p>
            <p>There are many variations on the Fawn color pattern, but if these are denoted, they will be considered as non-standard. These patterns include the apricot-fawn and silver-fawn.</p>
            <p>Fawn color pattern is a tan body with prominent black mask, black ears, black thumbprint on the forehead, and black stripe down the middle of the back.</p>
            <p>Colors such as white, brindle, and silver can be seen in the breed, but they are non-standard.</p>
            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>Pugs should be compact with well-developed muscles, around 14-18 pounds, with a square proportion.</p>
            <h3>Head and Face</h3>
            <p>The head should be large, round, but not apple-headed, with a soft expression that is full of fire.</p>
            <p>The ears should be thin, soft, like black velvet.</p>
            <p>Wrinkles on the face should be large and deep, and the muzzle should be short, blutn, square, but not uplifted. They should have a slight underbite.</p>
            <h3>Body</h3>
            <p>Their neck should be slightly arched, strong, and thick, and should be long enough to proudly carry the head.</p>
            <p>The back should be level, with a wide, well ribbed chest.</p>
            <h3>Legs</h3>
            <p>Legs should be straight, moderate length, and set under the body. Elbows should be under the shoulders when viewed from the side.</p>
            <p>All legs should be parallel to each other, and their feet should not be long nor round.</p>
            <h4>Tail</h4>
            <p>The tail should be as curled as possible, with a double curl considered as perfection.</p>

            <h2>Health Issues</h2>
            <p>Due to the flat faces of the Pug, they are considered brachocephalic, and some issues do come with this desirable trait.</p>
            <p>As in any flat-faced breed, breathing issues are common, with snoring being the most prevalent.</p>
            <p>Some individuals will need surgery to lengthen the nares and mitigate any issues with the flat-face.</p>
            <p>Due to the globular eyes, Pugs are also prone to eye ulcers and eye infections. Care should be taken to watch the eyes for any signs of these issues as well as to prevent any impact to the temples, which can cause the eye to protopse, or pop out.</p>
            <p>Other issues known to the Pug breed include patella luxation (where the kneecap moves out of place), hip dysplasia, and skin conditions. Please be sure to clean the wrinkles well!</p>
